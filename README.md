# CTF-Writeups

## Update: As of Fall 2024, I have moved new writeups to Medium! To be frank, formatting is a nightmare in .md files, so the rich text editor Medium brings is quite the blessing :). Check them out here: https://medium.com/@NTHSec.

This repository showcases my CTF adventure as I progress through the HTB THM and Vulnhub machines.

As of November 2023, I am a beginner in all things cybersecurity, but through HTB and THM, I am learning new things every day. My goal is to consistently upload write-ups to the repository, showcasing the new skills I learn. I hope this will help educate other beginners eager to jump into cybersecurity but unsure where to start.

If you are a complete newcomer (like me), I suggest going to [HTB Academy](academy.hackthebox.com) or [THM Hacktivities](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities) to get started. Their modules have taught me everything I know and will be my primary learning source throughout this journey. It's free, easy to follow, and super fun, so give it a shot!
